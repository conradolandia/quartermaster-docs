## Data model per trip/launch

X-marked items are required now for the MVP reservation system while others would be added in the future to support the static site or desired capabilities. The launch-related fields, while I came up with them without actually checking the documentation, precisely matches the [the r/SpaceX API](https://github.com/r-spacex/SpaceX-API/tree/master/docs#rspacex-api-docs) — convenient for future automated retrieval

A Launch can have multiple Missions (Take 1, Take 2, etc.) if the launch scrubs or is significantly delayed. Each Mission has its own set of Trips (both launch viewing and pre-launch trips). A Mission and its Trips could be created at the same time, or an existing Launch could be selected to associate a Mission to and automatically load the relevant data.

Eventually we could have presets (e.g. Starbase, Cape) that would autofill most of the launch info.

In the following lists, a checked mark indicates a required field.

## Capacity Tracking

Real-time capacity tracking is implemented through the following mechanism:

1. Each trip is associated with one or more boats through the trip_boats table
2. Each boat has a maximum capacity, which can be overridden at the trip level
3. When a booking is made:
   - The system checks available capacity before confirming
   - Capacity is reduced by the number of tickets purchased
4. When a booking is cancelled or refunded:
   - Capacity is restored for the affected trip/boat
5. Admin interface provides real-time capacity monitoring:
   - Total capacity per trip/boat
   - Booked capacity
   - Available capacity
   - Overbooked status (if admin override was used)

## QR Code Implementation

QR codes for tickets:

1. **Content**: URL with booking ID parameter
   - Example: `https://admin.star-fleet.tours/check-in?booking=ABC123`
2. **Generation**: Created upon successful booking completion
3. **Delivery**: Embedded in confirmation page and email
4. **Validation**: Admin selects active trip/boat context before scanning
5. **Check-in process**:
   - QR code is scanned
   - System validates booking against selected trip/boat context
   - On successful validation, relevant item status updated to "fulfilled"

## Data Retention

1. **User data**:
   - Basic contact information retained for operational communications
   - For guest checkouts: sensitive data (address, phone) purged after one year
   - Full retention for users who create accounts (future feature)
2. **Payment information**:
   - No credit card details stored in our system (handled by Stripe)
   - Payment references retained for refund processing
3. **Deletion requests**:
   - Manual process via contact form (MVP)
   - Self-service account deletion (future feature)
