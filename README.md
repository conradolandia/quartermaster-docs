# Quartermaster Project Documentation

This directory contains the comprehensive documentation for the Quartermaster project, a booking system for Starâœ¦Fleet Tours.

## Technology Stack

The Quartermaster system is built using the following technologies:

### Stage 0 (MVP)
- **Backend**: FastAPI (Python) with SQLModel ORM
- **Frontend**: React with TypeScript and Chakra UI
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **Infrastructure**: Docker, Docker Compose

The initial implementation is based on the [FastAPI Full-Stack Template](https://github.com/fastapi/full-stack-fastapi-template), providing a solid foundation with built-in authentication, database integration, and frontend components.

### Stage 2
- In Stage 2, we plan to migrate the frontend from React to Svelte for improved performance and developer experience.

## Documentation Structure

The documentation is organized into focused documents to support different aspects of the project:
