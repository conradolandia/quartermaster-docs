# Quartermaster MVP Simplification Strategy

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the strategy for simplifying the Quartermaster booking system for the MVP (Minimum Viable Product) phase. After reviewing the original system overview, data model, and implementation plan documents, we identified opportunities to reduce complexity while maintaining all core functionality required for the MVP. This simplified approach will enable faster development, easier maintenance, and a more streamlined implementation process.

## Core Simplification Principles

1. **Focus on MVP Requirements**: Eliminate features and complexity not needed for the initial launch
2. **Selective Entity Consolidation**: Combine related entities where separation doesn't provide immediate value, while maintaining critical distinctions
3. **Field Reduction**: Remove fields that aren't essential for core functionality
4. **Relationship Simplification**: Create more direct relationships between entities
5. **Admin-Driven Configuration**: Use the admin interface for entity management instead of complex configuration files
6. **Maintain Extensibility**: Design the simplified model to allow for easy expansion in future phases

## Key Simplifications

### 1. Entity Approach

| Entity Type | Approach | Rationale |
|-------------|----------|-----------|
| Launch and Mission entities | Maintain separation | Important to preserve the distinction between a physical launch and our organized viewing opportunities (missions) for that launch |
| Location and Jurisdiction entities | Maintain separation | Important to preserve the distinction between launch sites and legal jurisdictions for tax and operational purposes |
| Boat Provider and Boat entities | Simplified Boat entity with provider fields | Provider details can be attributes of boats for MVP, reducing join complexity |
| Swag as separate entity | Removed for MVP | Swag sales can be added in future phases; not essential for core booking functionality |

### 2. Field Reduction

- Removed fields related to advanced features (e.g., NET flags, precision levels, etc.)
- Simplified status tracking to essential states (active, refunded, fulfilled)
- Removed complex metadata fields not needed for basic functionality
- Consolidated address fields where appropriate (e.g., full address as text for MVP)

### 3. Relationship Simplification

- Streamlined relationships between entities while maintaining critical distinctions
- Simplified referencing between entities to reduce query complexity
- Removed unnecessary intermediate entities where possible

### 4. Configuration Approach

- Utilize the existing admin interface for entity management
- Focus on essential parameters for launch, mission, and trip configuration
- Create streamlined forms for entity creation and editing
- Reduce the number of configurable options to only what's needed for MVP

## Detailed Changes to Data Model

### Launch Table

The Launch table maintains its essential fields:

```
Launch Table:
- ID (UUID)
- Name
- Slug
- Launch timestamp
- Summary
- Location_id
- created_at/updated_at
```

### Mission Table

The Mission table maintains its connection to Launch:

```
Mission Table:
- ID (UUID)
- Launch_id
- Name
- Slug
- Active flag (taking reservations)
- Public flag (visible without special link)
- Sales open at
- Refund cutoff hours
- created_at/updated_at
```

### Boats Table (simplified)

The Boats table now incorporates provider information directly:

```
Boats Table:
- ID (UUID)
- Name
- Slug
- Capacity
- Provider name
- Provider location
- Provider address
- Map link
- created_at/updated_at
```

### Locations Table (simplified)

The Locations table now includes tax rate information directly:

```
Locations Table:
- ID
- Name
- Slug
- State
- Sales tax rate
- created_at/updated_at
```

### Overall Entity Structure

The simplified model maintains these core entities:

1. Admin Users
2. Launches
3. Missions
4. Locations
5. Jurisdictions
6. Boats (incorporating Provider)
7. Trips
8. Trip Boats
9. Bookings
10. Booking Items

## Benefits of the Simplified Approach

### 1. Reduced Development Time

- **Simpler API endpoints** with more focused relationships to manage
- **More straightforward UI requirements** with clearer entity distinctions
- **Reduced validation complexity** by removing unnecessary fields
- **Clearer domain model** respecting important business distinctions

### 2. Lower Complexity

- **Streamlined data flow** with focused entity relationships
- **Preserved critical domain distinctions** between launches/missions and locations/jurisdictions
- **Fewer edge cases** to handle for non-essential features
- **Easier to understand** for both developers and non-technical stakeholders

### 3. Easier Maintainability

- **Less complex SQL queries** needed for common operations
- **Clear entity separation** for important domain concepts
- **Fewer potential points of failure** with streamlined relationships
- **More straightforward debugging** with clearer data flow

### 4. Faster Deployment

- **Streamlined admin forms** for entity management
- **Reduced testing burden** focusing on core functionality
- **More focused scope** leading to clearer deployment goals
- **Maintained domain integrity** for future expansion

### 5. Improved User Experience

- **Clear booking flow** with appropriate entity distinctions
- **Streamlined admin interface** focused on core operations
- **Faster page loads** due to simplified data requirements
- **More direct customer interactions** with streamlined booking process

## Migration Path to Future Phases

The simplified MVP design intentionally allows for expansion in future phases:

1. **Launch and Mission entities** are already properly separated to support tracking multiple missions per launch
2. **Location and Jurisdiction entities** maintain separation for proper tax handling and geographic organization
3. **Boat and Provider separation** can be fully implemented when more complex provider management is needed
4. **Swag sales functionality** can be added by extending the booking items table
5. **User accounts system** can be implemented without disrupting the guest checkout flow

## Implementation Recommendations

1. **Start with core entities**: Launches, Missions, Locations, Jurisdictions, Boats, and Trips
2. **Implement booking flow** with proper entity relationships before adding administrative features
3. **Use FastAPI's dependency injection** to abstract data access, making future model changes easier
4. **Create clear interfaces** between layers to facilitate future extensions
5. **Develop focused admin forms** for entity management
6. **Focus initial admin interface** on the most common operations (viewing bookings, check-in)
7. **Document expansion points** for future development phases

## Implementation Order

1. Locations & Jurisdictions first
  - These are foundational reference data
  - Relatively simple with few dependencies
2. Launches
  - Build on Locations
  - Core entity that Missions depend on
3. Missions
  - Depend on Launches
  - Critical for organizing the business logic
4. Boats
  - Independent from the above flow
  - Can be implemented in parallel
5. Trips
  - Depend on Missions and Boats
  - Connect the physical resources to events
6. Bookings & BookingItems
  - Final layer that ties everything together
  - Most complex with dependencies on all above entities

## Conclusion

The simplified MVP approach focuses on delivering core functionality quickly and reliably while reducing unnecessary complexity. By selectively simplifying entities and relationships while maintaining critical domain distinctions, we can accelerate development while still providing a solid foundation for future expansion.

This strategy maintains all the essential functionality required for the MVP while reducing development time, lowering maintenance complexity, and improving the overall user experience. The model preserves important distinctions between launches/missions and locations/jurisdictions as specified, ensuring the system can properly represent the business domain while still simplifying where appropriate.
