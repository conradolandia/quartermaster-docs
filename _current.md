# Current plan of action

This is a step-by-step plan to tackle the remaining backend MVP features. We'll base this on the previous analysis and the requirements outlined in `docs/stages/stage0_mvp.md`. We will aim to write tests alongside each feature.

**Goal:** Complete the backend functionality required for Stage 0 (MVP).

**Plan of Action:**

1.  **Set Up Service Layer Structure:**
    *   **Action:** Create the `backend/app/services` directory.
    *   **Action:** Create skeleton service files for core logic domains identified as missing or likely needed: `MissionConfigService.ts`, `BookingService.ts`, `PaymentService.ts` (for Stripe interaction), `QrCodeService.ts`, `EmailService.ts`, `CsvExportService.ts`, `CheckInService.ts`, `RefundService.ts`.
    *   **Goal:** Establish the architectural pattern for separating business logic from controllers.
    *   **Consideration:** The skeleton service files appear to already exist, but some like `RefundService.ts`, `CheckInService.ts`, and `CsvExportService.ts` are just placeholders. Focus on implementing these rather than creating new ones.

2.  **Implement Mission Configuration Loading (YAML):**
    *   **Action:** Implement `MissionConfigService.ts` to read and parse the mission/trip configuration from a designated YAML file (e.g., `config/missions.yml` - we'll need to create this file based on the structure in `implementation_plan.md`).
    *   **Action:** Provide methods to retrieve mission/trip details, pricing, capacities, etc., based on a Launch ID or Mission ID.
    *   **Action:** Ensure controllers (e.g., `LaunchesController`, `MissionsController`, `TripsController`) can use this service to fetch configuration data instead of relying solely on database entries for configuration aspects.
    *   **Action:** Write unit tests for `MissionConfigService`.
    *   **Goal:** Fulfill the MVP requirement for mission configuration via YAML.
    *   **Consideration:** This service already exists (158 lines) and `missions.yml` exists in the data directory. Focus on enhancing this service with additional features like validation and better integration with admin workflows.

3.  **Implement Core Booking Creation Logic:**
    *   **Action:** Implement the main booking creation logic within `BookingService.ts`. This service will be called by `BookingsController.store`.
    *   **Action:** The service should:
        *   Validate input data (leveraging existing validators if applicable).
        *   Verify trip/boat availability and capacity using `MissionConfigService` and potentially database lookups for current bookings.
        *   Calculate subtotal, tax (using Jurisdiction data), and total based on selected items and quantities fetched from the configuration/database.
        *   Handle discount code logic (if implemented).
        *   Handle tip amount (validate non-negative).
        *   Create `Booking` and associated `BookingItem` records in the database with initial status 'active' or 'pending_payment'.
        *   Generate a unique `confirmation_code`.
    *   **Action:** Refactor `BookingsController.store` to primarily call `BookingService`.
    *   **Action:** Write integration tests for the booking creation flow.
    *   **Goal:** Implement the central booking creation process.
    *   **Consideration:** BookingService appears to be largely implemented (350 lines). Focus on review and enhancement rather than building from scratch.

4.  **Integrate Payment Processing (Stripe - Mock or Basic):**
    *   **Action:** Implement basic payment processing logic in `PaymentService.ts`, called after initial booking record creation in `BookingService`.
    *   **Action:** For MVP, this could be simplified:
        *   *Option A (Mock):* Simulate a successful payment and update the booking status to 'confirmed'.
        *   *Option B (Basic Stripe):* Implement basic Stripe `PaymentIntent` creation using the calculated `total_amount`. Store the `payment_intent_id` on the `Booking` record. Update booking status based on Stripe webhook confirmation (requires setting up a webhook endpoint).
    *   **Action:** Ensure the `Booking` status is updated appropriately (e.g., to 'confirmed' on success, potentially leaving as 'pending_payment' or 'failed' otherwise).
    *   **Action:** Write tests for the payment service interaction (using mocks for Stripe API calls).
    *   **Goal:** Integrate the payment step into the booking flow.
    *   **Consideration:** PaymentService exists but needs a more complete implementation. Consider starting with Option A (mock) to allow faster development of other features, then enhance with real Stripe API.

5.  **Implement QR Code Generation:**
    *   **Action:** Implement `QrCodeService.ts` to generate a data URL or buffer for a QR code.
    *   **Action:** The QR code should encode the Check-in URL (`https://admin.star-fleet.tours/check-in?booking=CONFIRMATION_CODE`).
    *   **Action:** Integrate this service call into the `BookingService` *after* successful payment/confirmation. The QR code data (or the URL it points to) should be included in the response/confirmation data.
    *   **Action:** Write unit tests for `QrCodeService`.
    *   **Goal:** Generate the QR code ticket required for confirmation.
    *   **Consideration:** This service appears to be implemented. Focus on reviewing and ensuring proper integration with the booking flow.

6.  **Implement Email Confirmation:**
    *   **Action:** Implement `EmailService.ts` to send emails, likely using Adonis Mail and configured SendGrid driver.
    *   **Action:** Create a basic email template (`resources/views/emails/booking_confirmation.edge`) to display booking summary and the QR code/link.
    *   **Action:** Trigger email sending from `BookingService` upon successful booking confirmation.
    *   **Action:** Write tests for the email service (mocking actual email sending).
    *   **Goal:** Fulfill the requirement for simple email confirmation.
    *   **Consideration:** The service exists with basic implementation and the email template exists. Mailtrap is configured for testing. Focus on adding error handling, retry logic, and comprehensive tests.

7.  **Implement Basic Admin Booking Retrieval:**
    *   **Action:** Ensure an admin-only endpoint exists (e.g., within a new `Admin/BookingManagementController.ts` or enhance existing controllers with admin middleware) to list all bookings.
    *   **Action:** Implement filtering (by date, status etc.) and basic search (by confirmation code, name, email) as required by the MVP dashboard.
    *   **Action:** Ensure necessary relationships (e.g., `BookingItems`) are preloaded or easily fetchable.
    *   **Action:** Write tests for the admin booking retrieval endpoint(s).
    *   **Goal:** Provide data for the admin dashboard's booking table.
    *   **Consideration:** Admin/booking_managements_controller.ts exists with basic implementation. Enhance with additional filtering and search capabilities.

8.  **Implement Check-in Marking:**
    *   **Action:** Create `Admin/CheckInController.ts` or add an endpoint to `Admin/BookingManagementController.ts`.
    *   **Action:** Implement the endpoint logic (potentially in `CheckInService.ts`):
        *   Takes a `bookingId` (or `confirmation_code`) and potentially context (trip/boat ID).
        *   Validates the booking and the context.
        *   Finds the relevant `BookingItem`(s).
        *   Updates the `status` of the appropriate `BookingItem`(s) to 'fulfilled'.
    *   **Action:** Write tests for the check-in marking endpoint.
    *   **Goal:** Fulfill the simple admin check-in functionality.
    *   **Consideration:** CheckInService exists as a placeholder. This should be a high priority implementation since it's critical for the venue staff on the day of the event.

9.  **Implement Refund Marking:**
    *   **Action:** Create `Admin/RefundManagementController.ts` or add an endpoint to `Admin/BookingManagementController.ts`.
    *   **Action:** Implement the endpoint logic (potentially in `RefundService.ts`):
        *   Takes `bookingId`, `itemIds`, `reason`, and `notes`.
        *   Finds the specified `BookingItem`(s).
        *   Updates their `status` to 'refunded'.
        *   Sets `refunded_at`, `refund_reason`, and `refund_notes`.
        *   *(MVP scope does NOT require calling Stripe API here, just marking)*.
    *   **Action:** Write tests for the refund marking endpoint.
    *   **Goal:** Fulfill the simple admin refund marking functionality.
    *   **Consideration:** RefundService exists as a placeholder. The MVP spec actually does mention "System automatically processes refund through Stripe API", so consider implementing this as well, but you could start with just the status marking.

10. **Implement CSV Export:**
    *   **Action:** Create `Admin/ExportDataController.ts` or similar.
    *   **Action:** Implement the endpoint logic (potentially in `CsvExportService.ts`):
        *   Fetches booking/passenger data based on filters (trip/mission).
        *   Formats the data into CSV format according to MVP requirements (name, email, phone, ticket quantity, boat).
        *   Returns the CSV data in the response with appropriate headers for download.
    *   **Action:** Write tests for the CSV export endpoint.
    *   **Goal:** Implement the passenger manifest CSV export.
    *   **Consideration:** CsvExportService exists as a placeholder. Consider using a library like fast-csv or json2csv for the CSV generation.

11. **Testing and Refinement:**
    *   **Action:** Review all implemented features and ensure adequate test coverage (unit and integration tests).
    *   **Action:** Refactor code where necessary, moving logic from controllers to services.
    *   **Action:** Perform a final review against the `stage0_mvp.md` requirements.
    *   **Goal:** Ensure a stable, tested, and complete backend MVP.
    *   **Consideration:** Focus on testing critical business logic like booking, payment, refund, and check-in flows. Consider setting up automated testing in CI/CD.

**Implementation Dependencies:**
- RefundService implementation depends on BookingService and potentially PaymentService
- CheckInService depends on BookingService for validation logic
- Both Email and QR code integration should happen after successful payment processing
- CSV Export depends on a robust query mechanism for Booking data

This plan provides a structured approach. We can tackle these steps sequentially, focusing first on the highest priority items: RefundService and CheckInService.

# Quartermaster Backend Development Continuation Prompt

## Project Context
I'm working on the Quartermaster project, a booking system for Star✦Fleet Tours that allows customers to book tickets for rocket launch viewing trips. The project uses AdonisJS (backend) with TypeScript and PostgreSQL, with Stripe for payments and email notifications.

## Current Implementation Status
The backend has a solid foundation with core models, controllers, and basic services in place. The database schema follows the designs in the documentation. However, several key MVP features still need completion:

1. **Partially Implemented:** 
   - Email service (basic structure exists with Mailtrap integration for testing)

   - Implement proper CSV formatting
   - **Expected deliverable:** CSV export endpoint with filtering options

6. **Secure Admin Routes:**
   - Apply proper authentication middleware
   - Move admin endpoints under protected routes
   - Implement role-based access controls
   - **Expected deliverable:** Secure admin API with proper authentication

## Technical Specifications
When implementing these features, follow these guidelines:

- Maintain AdonisJS MVC architecture with services for business logic
- Follow TypeScript conventions with proper typing
- Implement comprehensive error handling
- Keep controllers thin and move business logic to services
- Maintain database integrity with proper transactions
- Follow RESTful API principles for endpoints

## Additional Context
Previous issues encountered included:
- 401 Unauthorized errors during tests
- Database seeding issues with foreign key constraints and UUIDs
- Email template rendering issues

Can you help me implement the next component on the priority list with clean, well-structured code that follows the project's coding standards?
