# Quartermaster Stage 0: Minimal Viable Product (MVP)

## Overview

Stage 0 focuses on delivering a streamlined booking system that integrates with the existing Star✦Fleet Tours static website. This MVP will enable users to book tickets for upcoming launches, process payments securely, and receive confirmation with digital tickets. The admin interface will provide basic management capabilities for bookings and passenger manifests.

## Timeline

**Duration**: 1-2 months

- Parameters: launch ID and optional discount code
- Example URL: `https://book.star-fleet.tours/?launch=falcon9-123`
- Single page displays all booking options (launch and pre-launch trips)
- Mobile-first responsive design

#### 2. Booking Process

- **Step 0**: Trip Selection (via existing static site)
- **Step 1**: Trip Details Entry
  - Number of tickets selection
  - Boat selection (if multiple options)
  - Pre-launch trip options (if available)
  - Discount code field
  - Optional tip field with suggested amounts
  - Special requests text area
- **Step 2**: Confirmation and Payment
  - Itemized cost breakdown
  - Payment formula: [Subtotal - Discount] × (1 + Tax Rate) + Tip
  - Personal details collection (name, email, phone)
  - Billing address collection
  - Stripe payment processing
  - Terms and conditions acceptance
- **Step 3**: Confirmation/Ticket Delivery
  - Confirmation page with booking details
  - QR code ticket generation
  - Email confirmation with booking details
  - Persistent URL for accessing booking details

#### 3. Digital Tickets

- QR code ticket accessible via:
  - Confirmation page
  - Email link
  - Booking lookup (confirmation code + last name)
- QR code contains a URL link with booking ID parameter
- Example: `https://admin.star-fleet.tours/check-in?booking=ABC123`
- Admin selects active trip/boat before scanning to establish check-in context
- System validates if passenger has items for the selected trip/boat
- On successful validation, system updates relevant item status to "fulfilled"

### Admin-Facing Features

#### 1. Authentication System

- Secure admin login
- No public user accounts in MVP
- Password reset functionality

#### 2. Dashboard

- Summary statistics:
  - Total bookings
  - Revenue metrics
  - Passenger counts per trip
- Table of all bookings with:
  - Filtering options (date, refund_status, etc.)
  - Basic search functionality
  - Sorting capabilities

#### 3. Booking Management

- View booking details
- Context-aware check-in process:
  - Admin selects active trip/boat to establish check-in context
  - Admin scans QR code or enters booking ID manually
  - System validates booking against selected trip/boat
  - System displays detailed booking information and statistics
  - Admin confirms check-in, updating item status to "fulfilled"
- Simple "mark as refunded" functionality:
  - Select items to mark as refunded
  - Select refund reason from dropdown
  - Enter explanation notes (required for "Other" reason)

##### Refund Implementation Details

- Database tracking using item-level status field and reason dropdown
- Refund reason options:
  - Change in party size
  - Could not make launch date

  - Other (requires explanation)
- Admin workflow:
  1. View booking details
  2. Click "Process Refund" button
  3. UI shows all items pre-selected
  4. Deselect specific items if needed
  5. Select refund reason from dropdown
  6. Enter explanation notes (required if reason is "Other")
  7. System calculates refund amount based on selections
  8. Admin submits form
  9. System updates item status to "refunded" and sets refunded_at timestamp
  10. System automatically processes refund through Stripe API
  11. System displays confirmation with refund details
- This approach:
  - Provides structured data for reporting
  - Creates a streamlined admin experience
  - Eliminates manual Stripe dashboard work
  - Provides foundation for Phase 1 enhancements
