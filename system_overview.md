We're a collective of space fans organizing educational trips and launch experiences, and our continuing mission is to inspire kids and adults alike to dream big, work hard and keep looking toward the stars.

It all started with a simple idea: what if a group of space fans chartered a boat to get the best view possible of the first Falcon Heavy launch and landing? Since those humble beginnings with a few dozen enthusiasts, interest in the concept has taken off, with hundreds of kids, adults and families from all around the world going out with us, as well as attracting media attention and interest from other local organizations.

Thanks to the help of designers, programmers, web developers and more who've gone out on previous launches and want to help share the experience with others, we launched the Star✦Fleet Tours organization to help coordinate more viewing and educational opportunities, make it easier for interested folks to find out more and reserve their tickets, improve the quality of the overall experience and make our operation sustainable going forward to serve more people and launches than ever.

What hasn't changed, however, is our core mission: to share the wonder and excitement of spaceflight with people of all ages, backgrounds and previous launch experiences. Whether you're a veteran space buff who's seen hundreds of flights or a newcomer watching your very first; whether you've lived in the area all your life or are a traveler visiting from half a world away; and whether you're getting an up-close view of the many historic pads at the Cape and an exclusive peek at the rocket on the pad on our pre-launch tour, or watching the future take flight with the launch itself, we want to make sure you have with the experience of a lifetime—every time.

## Trips Overview

Each mission represents Star Fleet's organized viewing opportunity for a specific launch attempt. A mission contains one or more trips: typically a launch viewing trip and optional pre-launch trips.

Each trip has scheduled times: one for the boat's departure and another determined by the mission's launch time.

- Cancellation Policy for Registered Users:
  - Before the boat departs (or before a designated safety threshold), cancellations are eligible for a refund.
  - Once the boat has sailed or the safety threshold has been crossed, refunds cannot be issued because payment for the boat has already been processed.
- Mission Launch Cancellations:
  - If the mission launch is cancelled after the safety threshold, refunds are not provided, as these cancellations are beyond our control.
  - In such cases, passengers will receive perks such as guided visits to historical sites and local marine habitats, plus a ~30% discount on a future trip of their choice.

The old bookings website had the following text. A similar text may be presented to the user at booking time, so we should think about possible edits to this disclaimer:

> Tickets are valid for any day the mission launches, except if a scrub occurs after we leave port one hour prior to launch time (we offer a 25% discount on further attempts). Launch dates may change without warning; if you cannot make it, we may be able to offer a limited number of refunds for tickets or merchandise up to five business days in advance of the launch date, at our sole discretion. If you have any questions, please contact us before purchasing. Thanks!

**Note:** This text is only a reference from the old system. The policies and language will need to be updated for the new system to ensure clarity and accuracy.

## Entity Hierarchy and Relationships

The core hierarchy and relationship between key entities is:

1. **Launches**

   - Represents the actual rocket launch event (e.g., "SpaceX Starship Flight 9")
   - Each Launch belongs to a Location (launch site)
   - The external entity that Star Fleet missions revolve around
   - Example: "Falcon Heavy STP-2 Launch"

2. **Missions**

   - Star Fleet's organized viewing opportunity for a specific launch attempt
   - If a launch scrubs (cancels after boats go out), a new Mission is created for the next attempt
   - Identified with names like "Falcon Heavy - Take 1", "Falcon Heavy - Take 2"
   - Each Mission references a specific Launch
   - Each Mission has its own active status, public visibility, and sales opening time
   - The central organizing entity for Star Fleet operations

3. **Trips**

   - A specific boat excursion within a Mission
   - Two main types:
     - Launch Viewing Trip: To watch the actual rocket launch
     - Pre-Launch Trip: To view the rocket on the pad before launch
   - Pre-launch trips often have multiple departure times on the same day
   - Each Trip references a specific Mission (not a Launch directly)
   - Trips have specific details like boat assignments, departure times, capacity

4. **Bookings**

   - A customer's reservation record
   - Contains items for one specific mission (not across multiple mission attempts)
   - Each Booking is for a specific Mission (not across multiple Mission attempts)
   - Contains payment information, passenger details, status
   - Links to specific items through BookingItems

5. **BookingItems**

   - Individual line items within a Booking
   - May reference specific Trips and Boats
   - Includes quantity, price, and status information
   - Uses the status field to track refunds and fulfillment

This hierarchy ensures that:

- Multiple Mission attempts for the same Launch can be properly tracked
- Trips are correctly associated with specific Mission attempts
- Bookings are made at the Mission level, with items potentially spanning multiple Trips
- Refund and fulfillment status can be tracked at the individual item level

# Description of requirements

We will need a new bookings website, with an administrative interface for different roles (admin, future: boat liaison, captain) so users can buy tickets to scheduled trips (and cancel them), and admins can create and administer trips and passengers, issue refunds and cancel trips sending email notifications about the changes in trips to the users.

We require it to be secure, fast and realiable, and also easy to maintain.

Basically, we know the backend will require a database to preserve data, and produce a REST API in JSON format. This API will be used by the website interface to display, create and update data dynamically.

In future phases, we'll develop a public front-end with no login required, where an anonymous user can see upcoming trips in a calendar-type view. After clicking on a trip, the user would be presented with a detailed view, maybe in a slide in panel. In this detailed view, the user would be presented with a button to buy a trip. Buying a trip would require entering passenger details but not creating an account (guest checkout only for MVP).

For the MVP, we'll create a simple booking form that integrates with our existing static site.  

We will use Stripe for payments and refunds.

When a user buys a trip, the details of the transaction need to be sent to certain admin users.

## Tech stack

After evaluating several technology options and considering our project requirements, timeline constraints, and team composition, we have selected the following tech stack:

### Backend: FastAPI (Python)

  - Default state
    - For passengers-initiated: all items set to a refund quantity of 0
    - For admin-initiated: all items set to full refund quantity
  - "Refund All/None" buttons to quickly set all quantities to 0 or max
- Tip handling:
  - Passenger-initiated refunds
    - Refund 0 for passenger-initiated by default (like the other items)
    - Refund amount can be set manually or all refunded with Refund All
  - Admin-initiated refunds
    - Refund full for admins by default (like other items)
    - Can be unset if other items are/Refund None selected, but refunded automatically if all other items are refunded (cannot be unset in this case)
- Sales tax refund calculation:
  - Automatically calculated proportionally to subtotal refunded
- Refund reason options:
  - Change in party size
  - Could not make launch date
  - Unsatisfied with experience

  - Timestamp of payment
  - Payment amount
  - Stripe payment intent ID
  - Items purchased in this payment transaction
  - Status (paid, refunded, partially refunded)
- Refund allocation algorithm:
  - Start with the most recent payment
  - Refund line items that were purchased in that payment
  - If a line item spans multiple payments, refund from newest to oldest
  - Track refund status per line item and per payment
  - Maintain running totals to ensure no overpayment
- User experience considerations:
  - Users don't need to know about payment allocation details
  - Admins see payment history with refund status per transaction
  - System handles allocation automatically
- Database tracking:

### Handling Bookings and Items

1. **Item Status Tracking**

   - Individual booking items use a status field with values:
     - `active` - Default state, item is valid
     - `refunded` - Item has been refunded
     - `fulfilled` - Item has been fulfilled (ticket checked-in or swag delivered)
   - This approach allows different items within the same booking to have different statuses

2. **Supporting Separate Transactions**

   - For the MVP, focus on single-transaction bookings
   - Design the database to support future multiple transactions by including a `payment_intent_id` in the `Bookings` table
   - Defer implementation of "add-on" purchases until a future phase

3. **Item Tracking Implementation**
   - Use a single BookingItems table for all item types
   - Use the JSONB attributes field to store type-specific details
   - Implement application-level validation for the attribute structure

## Additional Considerations

### Legal and Compliance Elements

- **Privacy Policy Requirements**:

  - Standard privacy policy will be adopted and linked within the website UI and from Stripe
  - Only admins will have access to personal information (contact/address info)
  - Must address data collection, storage, usage, and sharing practices
  - Required for integration with Stripe and other third-party services

- **Payment Information Handling**:

  - No credit card/payment information will be stored on our servers
  - Will use Stripe Elements to ensure payment data never touches our systems
  - This approach avoids PCI-DSS compliance burden while maintaining security
  - Will store only reference tokens provided by Stripe for refund processing

- **Terms of Service**:

  - Existing terms cover booking conditions and cancellation policies
  - Will expand to include more detailed liability limitations
  - Will formalize customer behavior expectations and safety requirements
  - Need explicit consent mechanism during checkout (checkbox with summary and links to policies)
  - Booking/cancellation conditions may vary per launch based on captain negotiations

- **Data Retention Policies**:

  - For users with accounts: data stored indefinitely as a benefit of account creation
  - For guest checkouts: consider scrubbing sensitive data (address, phone, email) after one year
  - Note that Stripe retains customer data indefinitely regardless of our policies
  - Create procedures for handling data deletion requests:
    - Initially: manual process via contact form
    - Future: self-service account deletion option
  - Automated data purging for non-essential data (IPs, passive collection) in post-MVP phases

- **Compliance Considerations**:

  - **Accessibility Targets**:

    - Initial goal: WCAG 2.2 Level A compliance for essential booking functions
    - Full site goal: WCAG 2.2 Level AA compliance
    - Will use Chrome web tools and WCAG site for validation

  - **GDPR Considerations**:

    - Initially avoid using non-necessary cookies when possible
    - Implement GDPR-compliant privacy policy
    - Process for data deletion requests per GDPR requirements
    - For full system: implement cookie consent popup
    - Future: specific data deletion request option in contact form

  - **Security Measures**:
    - Implement site security best practices to prevent compromise
    - Use Stripe Elements to ensure no payment data touches our servers
    - Regular security audits and updates
    - HTTPS enforcement for all pages

### Mobile Strategy

- **MVP Mobile-First Approach**:

  - Design all interfaces with mobile as the primary usage scenario
  - Test on multiple device sizes during development
  - Ensure all critical functions (booking, viewing tickets, requesting refunds) work seamlessly on mobile
  - Desktop experience will enhance the mobile version rather than the reverse

- **Touch Optimization**:

  - Larger touch targets for buttons and interactive elements
  - Simple forms optimized for mobile input
  - Minimize typing requirements where possible

- **Responsive Considerations**:
  - Use fluid layouts that adapt to different screen sizes
  - Ensure readability of all text on small screens
  - Optimize images and assets for mobile data usage

### Error Handling and Logging Strategy

- **User-Facing Error Strategy**:

  - Friendly, non-technical error messages for users
  - Clear recovery paths when errors occur
  - Contextual guidance for resolving input errors

- **Backend Error Management**:

  - Structured error logging with severity levels
  - Transaction tracking across the system
  - Critical error notifications to administrators

- **Payment Error Handling**:

  - Special handling for Stripe integration errors
  - Clear communication about payment failures
  - Recovery options for abandoned transactions

- **Monitoring Implementation**:
  - Error tracking through Sentry
  - Regular review of error patterns
  - Performance monitoring for critical paths

### Performance Requirements

- **Initial MVP Performance Targets**:

  - Page load times under 3 seconds on 4G connections
  - Booking form submission under 5 seconds
  - Simple caching strategy for static content

- **Database Optimization**:

  - Efficient indexing for frequently queried fields
  - Simple query optimization for MVP
  - Monitoring of slow queries

- **Scaling Considerations for Future**:
  - Identify potential bottlenecks for high-traffic periods
  - Plan for vertical scaling on VPS initially
  - Document upgrade path for higher capacity needs

### External API Integration Details

- **Stripe Integration**:

  - Use [Stripe Elements](https://stripe.com/docs/elements) for secure payment form
  - Implement webhook handlers for payment events
  - Store payment intents and customer references
  - Plan for handling declined payments and retries

- **Email Service Integration**:

  - SendGrid API for transactional emails
  - Email templates for confirmations, updates, and receipts
  - Tracking of email delivery and open rates
  - Fallback procedures for email failures

- **Future Weather API Options**:
  - Research options: [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/api), [WeatherAPI](https://www.weatherapi.com/), [NOAA](https://www.weather.gov/documentation/services-web-api)
  - Focus on marine conditions and forecasting
  - Consider data refresh frequency requirements
  - Plan for display of relevant weather metrics

### MVP Backup Strategy

Even in the initial MVP phase, a basic backup strategy will be implemented:

- Database backups performed quarterly
- Backup frequency to be increased based on traffic and booking volume
- Simple backup scripts to automate PostgreSQL dumps
- Secure storage of backups on a separate system from the production environment
- Basic disaster recovery documentation for the operations team
- Test restoration procedure once per backup cycle

This minimal approach will protect against catastrophic data loss while more comprehensive backup and recovery strategies are developed for later phases.
